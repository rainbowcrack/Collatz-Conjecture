# Collatz-Conjecture
- The Collatz conjecture is a mathematical conjecture named after the German mathematician Lothar Collatz in 1937. It is also known as the "3n+1 Problem".
- This conjecture applies to any integer natural number. If the number (n) chosen by the user is even, simply divide it by 2 (n/2), and if it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 (n*3+1).
- Although there is still no solution or explanation, it is important for the studies of Number Theory and for attracting new young talents in mathematics.
